Leveraging Web3 to effect changes to sourcing automotive EV batteries


Movelo leverages blockchain technology to incentivize eco-friendly commuting choices such as walking or biking. By participating in campaigns sponsored by local businesses, users can earn rewards for choosing greener transportation options. Our smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain automates the process of tracking and rewarding these eco-conscious decisions.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

If you wish to serve the production build locally:
`yarn build`
`npm install -g serve`
`serve -s build`
